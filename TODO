TODO:
-----

* point to multipoint

* CLIs
    - add-tunnel, del-tunnel
    - show node, host, tunnel

* remove pipework dependency

* simplify rules - replace arp with broadcast flood?

* self learning VXLAN switch - learns remote address -> create_node done on leave nodes, not on switch (simpler config)


Open Questions:
---------------

* is STP enabled in ovs?
