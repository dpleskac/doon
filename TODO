* point to multipoint

* consolidate CLIs
    - add-node, del-node
    - add-host, del-host
    - add-ep, del-ep

* node 
	- need to add rule for local port (actions=output:LOCAL)

* host connect
	- simplify rules - replace arp with broadcast flood?
	- remove pipework dependency

* self learning VXLAN switch - learns remote address -> create_node done on leave nodes, not on switch (simpler config)


Open Questions:
---------------

* is STP enabled in ovs?
