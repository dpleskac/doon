* point to multipoint

* CLIs
    - add-tunnel, del-tunnel
    - show node, host, tunnel

* shall I eliminate local connection? YES! 
	- need to add rule for local port (actions=output:LOCAL)


* host connect
	- simplify rules - replace arp with broadcast flood?
	- remove pipework dependency

* self learning VXLAN switch - learns remote address -> create_node done on leave nodes, not on switch (simpler config)


Open Questions:
---------------

* is STP enabled in ovs?
